        "Recommender systems are a common feature in many digital platforms where user choice plays a central role. They provide significant benefits for both users and creators. For instance, Amazon’s recommendation engine has greatly increased user engagement and overall spending on its e-commerce site. For customers, these systems personalize the shopping experience by suggesting products that best match their preferences—whether inferred from individual browsing history or derived from broader popularity trends. Recommender systems have fundamentally transformed how users discover and interact with products online."
