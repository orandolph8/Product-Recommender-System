To my eye, it's as clear and sharp as the iPad Mini Retinal display.  And the display is quick!  Pages load fast, and the touchscreen is very responsive.<br /><br />In designing this little \\\"convertible\\\" laptop, Acer got the concept exactly right.  The display and keyboard together constitute a small notebook computer that is just large enough for doing real writing work.  (As long as you don't type too fast--there is a slight delay in communications between the keyboard and display.)  The built-in, buttonless mouse works smoothly, and I like the feature where you push the lower left or lower right corner of the mousepad to left-click or right-click.  (You do have to watch that you don't move the mouse pointer off target when you click.)  This laptop even comes with a one-year subscription to Microsoft Office 365 (software is installed, the activation code is in the box).<br /><br />But the \\\"convertible\\\" laptop is also a standalone tablet with a sensitive, fast touchscreen.  The display lifts off easily from two tabs at the back of the keyboard, so that you can check email, shop online, or search the Internet without holding up any extra keyboard weight.  When you're done using the tablet, the display clicks back onto the tabs, and the laptop closes up like any standard laptop (so you don't need a tablet cover, or even a screen protector for the touchscreen).  The settings that allow you to shut down or put the laptop to sleep when you close the cover work as usual. The display can also be detached and reattached facing backwards, so that the keyboard becomes a display stand.<br /><br />This little Windows 8.1 laptop can do a lot of things.  The display/tablet has a webcam, stereo speakers, a microphone for sound recording, a microSD card slot, a microUSB connector for connecting to USB devices, an HDMI micro connector that supports hi-def digital video connections, a headset/speaker jack,  and a DC-in jack for charging.<br /><br />The keyboard has a single USB port.  I used the USB port to connect an external CD/DVD drive and play music from a CDROM.  The USB port is also useful for file transfers via flash drive, or for backing up files to an external storage drive.  Because this little notebook has only 64GB storage capacity (other tablets have 16GB to 64GB storage capacity), you will almost certainly need to back up music, pictures, and other files to an external drive or to cloud storage eventually.  But you can also copy files off the tablet without using wireless or connecting the tablet via USB cable to another PC, because the tablet/keyboard combo is a full-fledged Win8.1 computer.<br /><br />I like this ACER ASPIRE SWITCH 10 a lot, because it is so compact, portable, extremely lightweight, and versatile. And  I even like the Windows 8.1 operating system, which makes a lot of sense for a small tablet computer like this one.\",\n          \"Good product and we use this daily. Highly recommend.\",\n          \"I actually bought these for a completely different use than with my laptop.
