Product Recommender System

Prototype Using NLP & Deep Learning

Overview

This repository contains a prototype product recommender system developed as a final project for DSCI 590 – NLP & Deep Learning at Indiana University Bloomington (Fall 2025).

The system demonstrates the core building blocks of modern recommender systems, including:

Text preprocessing and tokenization

NLP-based semantic embeddings

Collaborative filtering with neural networks

User–item index mapping

Top-N recommendation generation

A lightweight interactive interface

The project is intended as a conceptual and technical prototype, not a production-ready recommender.
